          Full Stack Web Developer with a background in business management and
          VOIP systems. Recently completed the Full Stack Web Development
          bootcamp certification provided through The University of Texas at
          Austin that focused on HTML/CSS, Javascript, Node.js, React, Git and
          more. I am very passionate about learning new things and challenging
          myself. Being adaptable, self-motivated, resourceful, and driven,
          allow me to thrive in group and independent working environments. I
          find fulfillment in opportunities to sharpen my skills and grow with a
          team as well as contribute to the success of any project Iâ€™m given. I
          excel in leadership roles due to my appreciation for the value others
          can bring through unique ideas and more efficient ways of
          accomplishing goals.
